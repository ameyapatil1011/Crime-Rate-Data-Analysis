Data:
The dataset should include information about different crime incidents such as the type of crime, date, location, and other relevant attributes. Ensure that your dataset is in the correct format before running the script.
Analysis:
Histogram Analysis:
The script generates histograms to visualize the distribution of crime incidents over time or in specific regions. The histograms help identify trends and patterns in the data.

Certainly! Below is an example README file for a crime data analysis project on GitHub. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to use the code, and details on the various analyses performed on the crime data.
